# AI-DRIVEN-DETECTION-OF-ILLEGAL-DEFORESATATION-FROM-MULTI-TEMPORAL-SATELLITE-IMAGE

## Overview
An AI-based system to detect illegal deforestation from multi-temporal satellite images using CNNs.
The system classifies forest and deforested regions and provides confidence scores via a Flask web app.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- CNN
- Flask
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Pandas

## Features
- Satellite image preprocessing (NDVI, normalization)
- CNN-based classification
- Flask web interface for image upload
- Prediction confidence and heatmap visualization

## Results
- Dataset size: 2000+ satellite images
- Model accuracy: XX%
- Real-time prediction support

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
